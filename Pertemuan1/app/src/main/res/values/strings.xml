    <string name="textScroll">Traxex, the Drow Ranger, is a ranged agility hero whose greatest assets are her incredible damage and ability to keep threats at bay. Traxex is a carry who, though lacking survivability, provides a worthwhile contribution through her damage alone. The Drow Ranger can be extremely powerful at any point in the game.
        As an agility hero, Traxex"'"s damage is based largely on her basic attacks and is among the greatest largely due to the massive amounts of bonus proc damage she gains from her passive ultimate, Marksmanship. The Drow Ranger also adds ranged attack speed to teammates with her global Precision Aura. Despite her lack of escape spells, Drow Ranger can keep herself relatively safe from enemy spellcasters and melee heroes using her Gust and her Frost Arrows, respectively. Frost Arrows infuses her attacks with ice, greatly slowing down her enemies. Since it can be manually cast, Frost Arrows can be used to harass her foes in the early game without drawing the creeps"'" attention. Gust is a great counter to enemy spellcasters as well as melee heroes as Gust pushes heroes away from Drow and prevents them from casting spells, who might threaten her life in battles. Position is of utmost importance as Traxex is quite vulnerable in close combat and the proc damage bonus from Marksmanship is removed when enemies come near her. This means she struggles against melee heroes with high mobility.
